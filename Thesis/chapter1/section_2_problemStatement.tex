\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemStatement}

Natural language tasks such as multi-hop question answering and long-document summarization pose significant challenges for LLMs, as they require complex reasoning skills. While numerous benchmarks have been developed to evaluate a model's ability to reason under these circumstances, further exploration is needed to understand not only how different memory structures affect model performance but also how various retrieval algorithms influence overall effectiveness. \\

\noindent Additionally, different prompting techniques, including iterative prompting, have been developed but remain largely unexplored in the context of enabling long-term memory for LLMs.
