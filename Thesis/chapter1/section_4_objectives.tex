\subsection{General Objective}
Compare the performance of various RAG strategies in solving natural language tasks that require long inputs, such as multi-hop question answering.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Implement a RAG framework that incorporates both semantic and lexical search using hybrid memory structures.
    \item Evaluate the system's performance against baseline models, including graph-based RAG and naive RAG.
    \item Develop a dataset for multi-hop question answering in Spanish to assess how different architectures perform in a multilingual setting.
\end{enumerate}
