\subsection{General Objective}
Evaluate the performance of three agent-based architectures designed to implement long-term memory in solving natural language long-input tasks including QA and MHQA.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and implement three agent-based architectures for long-term memory incorporating principles from cognitive science.
    \item Evaluate the systems using $R@2$ and $R@5$ for retrieval performance and Exact Match (EM) and $F1$ score for QA across four benchmark datasets: LoCoMo, HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA \cite{maharana-etal-2024-evaluating}\cite{yang2018hotpotqa}\cite{trivedi2021musique}\cite{ho-etal-2020-constructing}.
