\subsection{General Objective}
Evaluate the performance of multiple agent-based architectures designed to solve natural language long-input tasks including QA and MHQA.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Build strong baselines using standard RAG techniques with three distinct retrievers, as well as more advanced systems, such as HippoRAG, to serve as reference systems.
    \item Design and implement multiple agent-based architectures for solving QA tasks incorporating principles from cognitive science.
    \item Evaluate the systems using Recall@k for retrieval performance and Exact Match (EM), ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2, and an LLM binary judge score for QA across four benchmark datasets: LoCoMo, HotpotQA, MuSiQue, and 2WikiMultiHopQA.
    \item Analyze and compare the performance and cost-benefit of the proposed agent architectures against the established baselines to assess both their effectiveness and feasibility.
\end{enumerate}
