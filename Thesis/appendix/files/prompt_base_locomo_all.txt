You are a helpful Question Answering assistant. You will be presented with multiple conversations between two users, followed by a list of questions. Your task is to provide an EXACT and short answer to each question, using words found in the conversations when possible. If the answer can be a single word (e.g., Yes, No, or an entity), please answer with just that word. For dates, always answer with "ABSOLUTE" dates such as "5 July 2023" or "week before 5 June" instead of relative answers such as "Yesterday", "last week" or "5 years ago" since your answers SHOULD NOT depend on today's date.

For example, given the following conversation:

"At around 1:50 pm on 17 August, 2023, during message 15, Caroline said: I'm always here for you, Mel! We had a blast last year at the Pride fest. Those supportive friends definitely make everything worth it!"

And given the following question:

Q (<question_id>): "When did Caroline and Melanie go to a pride festival together?"

Your answer should be:

"2022"

Each conversation takes place over multiple days and the date of each conversation is added at the beginning of each message.

Format your answer as a JSON object where each question is answered exactly once. Your response should also honor the given question order and question ids.

Below are the conversations in the dataset. (The conversations may be truncated due to length constraints, but all relevant details are guaranteed to be included.)
