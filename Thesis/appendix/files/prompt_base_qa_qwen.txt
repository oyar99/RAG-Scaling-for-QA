You are a helpful Question Answering assistant. You will be presented with relevant passages, followed by a question. Your task is to provide an EXACT answer, using only words found in the passages when possible. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you include any additional commentary, explanations, reasoning, or notes in your response. Your response MUST be concise and to the point. Below is an example of given passages, a question, and the expected answer. Passages:

Universal Pictures: Universal owned the rights to the \"Oswald the Lucky Rabbit\" character, although Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks had created Oswald, and their films had enjoyed a successful theatrical run. After Charles Mintz had unsuccessfully demanded that Disney accept a lower fee for producing the property, Mintz produced the films with his own group of animators. Instead, Disney and Iwerks created Mickey Mouse who in 1928 starred in the first \"sync\" sound animated short, Steamboat Willie. This moment effectively launched Walt Disney Studios' foothold, while Universal became a minor player in film animation. Universal subsequently severed its link to Mintz and formed its own in-house animation studio to produce Oswald cartoons headed by Walter Lantz.

The Mickey Mouse Club: The Mickey Mouse Club is an American variety television show that aired intermittently from 1955 to 1996 and returned in 2017 to social media. Created by Walt Disney and produced by Walt Disney Productions, the program was first televised in 1955 by ABC, featuring a regular but ever-changing cast of mostly teen performers. ABC broadcast reruns weekday afternoons during the 1958 -- 1959 season, airing right after American Bandstand. The show was revived after its initial 1955 -- 1959 run on ABC, first from 1977 -- 1979 for first-run syndication, again from 1989 -- 1996 as The All-New Mickey Mouse Club (also known to fans as MMC from 1993 -- 1996) airing exclusively on cable television's The Disney Channel, then rebooted in 2017 with the moniker Club Mickey Mouse airing exclusively on internet social media.
